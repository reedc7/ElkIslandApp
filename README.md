# ElkIslandApp
This app allows for visualization of data taken from Open Data Canada, created by Jonathan DeMoor and Colleen Arnison. The data were collected using surveys of elk, moose, deer, and bison populations in Elk Island National Park, in Alberta, Canada. Using the app, select one of these species from the drop down menu on the left side of the screen, and see a scatterplot of average fall population estimates between 1905-2017 for that species. If you want to see the year and number of animals with greater specificity, click and drag your cursor across the points of interest in the scatterplot, and a table displaying the year and average population estimate will appear beneath the plot.
